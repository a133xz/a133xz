# 👨‍💻 I'm Antonio

Hola, I build things for the web. 

Currently, I’m a technology consultant for startups, specialising in front end architecture, scalability, and Vuejs. In the past, I’ve built mobile apps, and helped Fintechs ship and scale their products.

📮 I'm always keen to connect. To contact me, visit [my website](https://antonio-r.now.sh/).

### PS.
- My GitHub is home to a bunch of open source projects, mostly created to solve my friends’ problems
