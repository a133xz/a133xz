# 👨‍💻 I'm Antonio

Hola, I build things for the web.

I care about front-end architecture, scalability, Vuejs and Open Source. I've built mobile apps, and helped Fintechs to ship and scale their products. Now, I help the world better understand the internet. Along the way, I’ve jumped from Spain to Edinburgh to London.

Sometimes I do music and web experiments. You can visit [my website](https://antonio-r.now.sh/) to find more info.
